# Welcome to BuddyBuddy

## Introduction

Welcome to the README for BuddyBuddy. This document will guide you through setting up and using our application. BuddyBuddy is designed to empower DApp owners in launching onchain auditable marketing campaigns that effortlessly attract a larger pool of OG community members, all with just a few clicks!

## Getting Started

To get started with BuddyBuddy, follow these steps:

1. Visit [our setup page](http://45.76.188.177/setup.html) to access the setup page.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup process.
3. Once setup is complete, our app will deploy a contract for you on your selected chain.

As of now, the user's data will be provided by the DApp owner, and we will submit the data and store it into blobs.

At the end of the campaign, the data will be aggregated and therefore a leaderboard and points for each user will be shown in a dashboard.

Lastly, DApp owners can use the Reward tab to design their unique token economy and distribute rewards to their users according to the leaderboard.
